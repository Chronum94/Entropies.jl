    CountOccurrences  <: CountingBasedProbabilityEstimator

A probabilities/entropy estimator based on straight-forward counting of distinct elements in
a univariate time series or multivariate dataset. From these counts, construct histograms.
Sum-normalize histograms to obtain probability distributions.
