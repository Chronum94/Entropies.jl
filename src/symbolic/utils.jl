export encode_motif

""" 
    encode_motif(x, m::Int = length(x)) â†’ Int

Encode the length-`m` motif `x` (a vector of indices that would sort some vector `v` in ascending order) 
into its unique integer symbol, using Algorithm 1 in Berger et al. (2019)[^Berger2019].

## Example 

```julia
v = rand(5)

# The indices that would sort `v` in ascending order. This is now a permutation 
# of the index permutation (1, 2, ..., 5)
x = sortperm(v)

# Encode this permutation as an integer.
encode_motif(x)
```
